## What Makes Our Application Unique

Our Wajenzi Landing Platform stands out because it transforms a simple community website into a **dynamic, interactive, and engagement-driven ecosystem**. We introduce features that strengthen **leadership transparency**, **community participation**, and **event management** — all within a modern, user-friendly interface.

### 🎖️ Leadership Contribution Scoreboard

We have built a **live leaderboard** that highlights how much each member has contributed to the Wajenzi open-source ecosystem.

**Why it’s unique:**

- Displays contributors’ GitHub profiles, usernames, and total contributions  
- Assigns rank badges (Gold, Silver, Bronze) to recognize top performers  
- Automatically updates contribution counts  
- Makes open-source work visible and celebrated  
- Encourages new and existing members to actively contribute  
- Promotes a culture of transparency and leadership through action  

This feature transforms contribution tracking into a **gamified community motivation system**.

### 📅 Events Showcase (Past & Upcoming)

We don’t just list events — we present them in a visually engaging and informative way.

**Features include:**

- A carousel slider for past events with banners, descriptions, and dates  
- Detailed display of upcoming events  
- Smooth transitions and animations for a premium user experience  
- Supabase-powered backend for storing event details and images  

This makes our platform a **living archive of the community’s journey and activities**.

### 🎟️ Event Registration & RSVP System

Our platform allows users to **actively participate** in community events, not just view them.

**Users can:**

- Register for events  
- RSVP directly from the website  
- See confirmation of their RSVP  
- View how many people have registered (optional)  

**Organizers can:**

- Track attendees via Supabase  
- Plan better based on RSVP numbers  
- Manage future event communications  

This feature transforms our landing page into a **mini event management system**, boosting engagement and improving communication.
